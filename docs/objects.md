This document outlines the object translation logic between AKO and the Avi controller. It's assumed that the reader is minimally versed with both
Kubernetes object semantics and the Avi Object semantics.

### Service of type loadbalancer

AKO creates a Layer 4 virtualservice object in Avi corresponding to a service of type loadbalancer in Kubernetes. Let's take an example of such a service object in Kubernetes:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: avisvc-lb
  namespace: red
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    name: eighty
  selector:
    app: avi-server
```

AKO creates a dedicated virtual service for this object in kubernetes that refers to reserving a virtual IP for it. The layer 4 virtual service uses a pool section logic based on the ports configured on the service of type loadbalancer. In this case, the incoming port is port `80` and hence the virtual service listens on this ports for client requests. AKO selects the pods associated with this service as pool servers associated with the virtualservice.

#### Service of type loadbalancer with preferred IP

Till Kubernetes version 1.23, Kubernetes' service objects allow controllers/cloud providers to create services with user-specified IPs using the `loadBalancerIP` field. AKO supports the `loadBalancerIP` field usage where-in the corresponding Layer 4 virtualservice objects are created with the user provided IP. Example usage for this could look something like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: avisvc-lb
  namespace: red
spec:
  loadBalancerIP: 10.10.10.11
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    name: eighty
  selector:
    app: avi-server
```
As `spec.loadBalancerIP` field has been deprecated from kubernetes version 1.24 onwards, AKO has introduced a new annotation `ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip` to L4 service that will be used to specify preferred IP. Example usage could look something like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: avisvc-lb
  namespace: red
  annotations:
    ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip: "10.20.10.100"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    name: eighty
  selector:
    app: avi-server
```

***Note***:
1. If customer is upgrading to Kubernetes version 1.24+, user has to manually update L4 service definition with above annotation in case user wants to use preferred IP feature.
2. User should specify either `ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip` annotation or `spec.loadBalancerIP` field in service definition if kubernetes version is less than 1.24.
3. User should specify same IP address to the service when transitioning from `spec.loadBalancerIP` to `ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip` annotation.

Avi does not allow users to update preferred virtual IPs bound to a particular virtualservice. Therefore in order to update the user preferred IP, it is required to re-create the Service object, failing which Avi/AKO throws an error. The following transition cases should be kept in mind, and for these, an explicit Service re-create with changed configuration is required.
 - updating loadBalancerIP value, from `loadBalancerIP: 10.10.10.11` to `loadBalancerIP: 10.10.10.22`.
 - updating annotation `ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip` value, from `ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip: 10.20.10.100` to `ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip: 10.20.10.110`
 - adding `loadBalancerIP` value or annotation `ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip` value after the Service is assigned an IP from Avi.
 - removing `loadBalancerIP` value or `ako.vmware.com/load-balancer-ip` value after the Service is assigned an IP from Avi.

Recreating the Service object deletes the Layer 4 virtualservice in Avi, frees up the applied virtual IP and post that the Service creation with update configuration should result in the intended virtualservice configuration.

#### DNS for Layer 4

If the Avi Controller cloud is not configured with an IPAM DNS profile then AKO will sync the Service of type Loadbalancer but an FQDN for the Service won't be generated. However, if the DNS IPAM profile is configured the user has the choice
to add FQDNs for Service of type Loadbalancer using the `autoFQDN` [value](values.md#l4settingsautofqdn) feature.

AKO also supports the [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-specify-a-dns-name-for-my-kubernetes-objects) format for specifying layer 4 FQDNs using the annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` on the Loadbalancer object. This annotation overrides the `autoFQDN` feature for service of type Loadbalancer.

### Insecure Ingress.

Let's take an example of an insecure hostname specification from a Kubernetes ingress object:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myinsecurehost.avi.internal
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /foo
          backend:
            serviceName: service1
            servicePort: 80
```

For insecure host/path combinations, AKO uses a Sharded VS logic where based on the `hostname` value (`myhost.avi.internal`), a pool object is created on a Shared VS when shard VS size is `LARGE` or `MEDIUM` or `SMALL`. A shared VS typically denotes a virtualservice in Avi that is shared across multiple ingresses. A priority label is associated on the poolgroup against it's member pool (that is created as a part of
this ingress), with priority label of `myhost.avi.internal/foo`.

An associated datascript object with this shared virtual service is used to interpret the host fqdn/path combination of the incoming request and the corresponding pool is chosen based on the priority label as mentioned above.

With `DEDICATED` shard VS size, AKO will create a normal VS (no virtual hosting enabled) for each unique host for secure/insecure ingress/route. AKO will apply all host rule specific settings, SSL profile, SSL KeyandCertificate on VS. Redirecting traffic to appropriate pool will be done using a httppolicyset object attached to VS. For secure ingress, there will httppolicyset attached to VS which will redirect traffic from port 80 to 443.

The paths specified are interpreted as `STARTSWITH` checks. This means for this particular host/path if pool X is created then, the matchrule can
be interpreted as - If the host header equals `myhost.avi.internal` and path `STARTSWITH` `foo` then route the request to pool X.

### Secure Ingress

Let's take an example of a secure ingress object:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - myhost.avi.internal
    secretName: testsecret-tls
  rules:
    - host: myhost.avi.internal
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /foo
          backend:
            serviceName: service1
            servicePort: 80
```

##### SNI VS per secure hostname

When shard VS size is `LARGE` or `MEDIUM` or `SMALL`, AKO creates an SNI child VS to a parent shared VS for the secure hostname. The SNI VS is used to bind the hostname to an sslkeycert object.
The sslkeycert object is used to terminate the secure traffic on Avi's service engine. In the above example the `secretName` field denotes the
secret asssociated with the hostname `myhost.avi.internal`. AKO parses the attached secret object and appropriately creates the sslkeycert
object in Avi. The SNI virtualservice does not get created if the secret object does not exist in Kubernetes corresponding to the
reference specified in the ingress object.

##### Traffic routing post SSL termination

On the SNI VS, AKO creates httppolicyset rules to route the terminated (insecure) traffic to the appropriate pool object using the host/path
specified in the `rules` section of this ingress object.

##### Redirect secure hosts from http to https

Additionally - for these hostnames, AKO creates a redirect policy on the shared VS (parent to the SNI child) for this specific secure hostname.
This allows the client to automatically redirect the http requests to https if they are accessed on the insecure port (80).

##### Multi-Port Service Support

A kubernetes service can have multiple ports. In order for a `Service` to have multiple ports, kubernetes mandates them to have a `name`.
Users could choose their ingress paths to route traffic to a specific port of the Service using this `name`. In order to understand the utility,
consider the following Service:

```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-svc
    spec:
      ports:
      - name: myport1
        port: 80
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 80
      - name: myport2
        port: 8080
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 8090
      selector:
        run: my-svc
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP
```

In order to use this service across 2 paths, with each routing to a different port, the Ingress spec should look like this:

```
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: myhost.avi.internal
        http:
          paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: service1
              servicePort: myport1
            path: /foo
      - host: myhost.avi.internal
        http:
          paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: service1
              servicePort: myport2
            path: /bar
```

As you may note that the service ports in case of multi-port `Service` inside the ingress file are `strings` that match the port names of
the `Service`. This is mandatory for this feature to work.

### Namespace Sync in AKO

Namespace Sync feature allows the user to sync objects from specific namespace/s with Avi controller.

New parameters has been introduced as config options in AKO's values.yaml. To use this feature, set the value of these parametes to a non-empty string.

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Default** |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `AKOSettings.namespaceSelector.labelKey` | Key used as a label based selection for the namespaces. | empty |
| `AKOSettings.namespaceSelector.labelValue` | Value used as a label based selection for the namespaces. | empty |

If either of the above values is left empty then AKO would sync objects from all namespaces with AVI controller. Any changes in values of these parameters will require AKO reboot.

Once user boots up AKO with this setting, user has to label a namespace with same key:value pair mentioned in values of labelKey and labelValues. For example, if user has specified values as labelKey:"app" and labelValue: "migrate" in values.yaml, then user has to label namespace with "app: migrate".

```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: "2020-12-04T13:20:42Z"
      labels:
        app: migrate
      name: red
      resourceVersion: "14055620"
      selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/red
      uid: a424bf13-2f4a-4005-a84d-f2fb65acfda0
    spec:
      finalizers:
      - kubernetes
    status:
      phase: Active
```

AKO will sync all objects from correctly labelled namespace/s.

If the label of 'red' namespace is changed from "app: migrate" (valid) to "app: migrate1" (invalid), then following objects of 'red' namespace will be deleted from AVI controller
- pools associated with, insecure ingresses/routes 
- SNI VSes associated with secure ingresses/routes 
- VSes associated with L4 objects 

AKO will sync back objects of a namespace with AVI controller if namespace label is changed from an invalid lable to a valid label.

### AKO created object naming conventions

In the current AKO model, all kubernetes cluster objects are created on the `admin` tenant in Avi. This is true even for multiple kubernetes clusters managed through a single IaaS cloud in Avi (for example - vcenter cloud). This poses a challenge where each VS/Pool/PoolGroup is expected to be unique to ensure no conflicts between similar object types.

AKO uses a combination of elements from each kubernetes objects to create a corresponding object in Avi that is unique for the cluster.

##### L4 VS names

The formula to derive a VirtualService (vsName) is as follows:

```
vsName = clusterName + "--" + namespace + "-" + svcName`
```

`clusterName` is the value specified in values.yaml during install.
`svcName` refers to the service object's name in kubernetes.
`namespace` refers to the namespace on which the service object is created.

##### L4 pool names

The following formula is used to derive the L4 pool names:

```
poolName = vsName + "-" + listener_port`
```

Here the `listener_port` refers to the service port on which the virtualservice listens on. As it can be intepreted that the number of pools will be directly associated with the number of listener ports configured in the kubernetes service object.

##### L4 poolgroup names

The poolgroup name formula for L4 virtualservices is as follows:

```
poolgroupname = vsName + "-" + listener_port`
```

##### Shared VS names

The shared VS names are derived based on a combination of fields to keep it unique per kubernetes cluster. This is the only object in Avi that does not derive it's name from any of the kubernetes objects.

```
ShardVSName = clusterName + "--Shared-L7-" + <shardNum>
```

`clusterName` is the value specified in values.yaml during install. "Shared-L7" is a constant identifier for Shared VSes
`shardNum` is the number of the shared VS generated based on hostname based shards.

##### Shared VS pool names

The formula to derive the Shared VS pool is as follows:

```
poolName = clusterName + "--" + priorityLabel + "-" + namespace + "-" + ingName
```

Here the `priorityLabel` is a combination of the host/path combination specified in each rule of the kubernetes ingress object. `ingName` refers to the name of the ingress object while `namespace` refers to the namespace on which the ingress object is found in kubernetes.

##### Shared VS poolgroup names

The following is the formula to derive the Shared VS poolgroup name:

```
poolgroupname = vsName
```

Name of the Shared VS Poolgroup is the same as the Shared VS name.

##### SNI child VS names

The following is the formula to derive the SNI child VS names, for `LARGE`, `MEDIUM`, `SMALL` shard VS size:

```
vsName = clusterName + "--" + sniHostName
```

For `DEDICATED` shard VS size, VS name will be derived as:

```
vsName = clusterName + "--" + sniHostName + "-L7-dedicated"
```

##### SNI pool names

The formula to derive the SNI virtualservice's pools, for `LARGE`, `MEDIUM`, `SMALL` shard VS size, is as follows:

```
poolName = clusterName + "--" + namespace + "-" + host + "_" + path + "-" + ingName
```

For `DEDICATED` shard VS size, pool name will be derived as:

```
poolName = clusterName + "--" + namespace + "-" + host + "_" + path + "-" + ingName + "-L7-dedicated"
```

Here the `host` and `path` variables denote the secure hosts' hostname and path specified in the ingress object.

##### SNI poolgroup names

The formula to derive the SNI virtualservice's poolgroup, for `LARGE`, `MEDIUM`, `SMALL` shard VS size, is as follows:

```
poolgroupname = clusterName + "--" + namespace + "-" + host + "_" + path + "-" + ingName
```

For `DEDICATED` shard VS size, poolgroup name will be derived as:
```
poolgroupname = clusterName + "--" + namespace + "-" + host + "_" + path + "-" + ingName + "-L7-dedicated"
```

Some of these naming conventions can be used to debug/derive corresponding Avi object names that could prove as a tool for first level trouble shooting.

##### Pool pkiprofile names

The formula to derive the pool's PKIprofile is as follows:

```
pkiprofilenam = poolName + "-pkiprofile"
```
### Markers for Avi Objects

With Avi controller version 20.1.5, Avi objects can be labelled with markers. Each marker is a pair of `key` : `<value1>`, `<value2>`. Each object can have multiple markers. Markers are used to group/filter objects on the Avi Controller and can be utilised to provide user access permissions using the GRBAC feature on the Avi Controller.

Avi controller support markers to all license types from 20.1.6.

From AKO 1.5.1, markers would be added to all the AKO created Avi Objects.

Each object will be marked with fields such as OpenShift/Kubernetes namespaces to which the object belongs, fqdn present in the ingress/route objects, service names present in the ingress/route objects. This will help in identifying object associate with specific ingress/route at controller side. Markers will be added to objects in SNI and EVH deployment modes.

ServiceName      : <servicename>
```

### NodePort Mode

#### Insecure and Secure Ingress/Routes in NodePort mode

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service1
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 31013
    name: eighty
  selector:
    app: avi-server
```

In `NodePort` mode, Service `service1` should be of type `NodePort`. There is no change in naming of the objects of VS and pool. AKO populates the Pool server object with `node_ip:nodeport`. If there are 3 nodes in the cluster with Internal IP being `10.0.0.100, 10.0.0.101, 10.0.0.102` and assuming that there’s no node label selectors used, AKO populates pool server as: `10.0.0.100:31013, 10.0.0.101:31013, 10.0.0.101:31013`.

If `service1` is of type `ClusterIP` in NodePort mode. Pool servers will be empty for ingres/route referring to the service.

#### Service of type loadbalancer In NodePort mode

Service of type `LoadBalancer` automatically creates a NodePort. AKO populates the pool server object with `node_ip:nodeport`.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: avisvc-lb
  namespace: red
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 31013
    name: eighty
  selector:
    app: avi-server
```

In the above example, AKO creates a dedicated virtual service for this object in kubernetes that refers to reserving a virtual IP for it. If there are 3 nodes in the cluster with Internal IP being `10.0.0.100, 10.0.0.101, 10.0.0.102` and assuming that there’s no node label selectors used, AKO populates pool server as: `10.0.0.100:31013, 10.0.0.101:31013, 10.0.0.101:31013`.

### NodePortLocal Mode

With Antrea as CNI, there is an option to use NodePortLocal feature using which a Pod can be directly reached from an external network through a port in the Node. In this mode, Like serviceType NodePort, ports from the kubernetes Nodes are used to reach application in the kubernetes cluster. But unlike serviceType NodePort, with NodePortLocal, an external Load Balancer can reach the Pod directly without any interference of kube-proxy.

To use NodePortlocal, the feature has to be enabled in the feature gates of [Antrea](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/main/docs/feature-gates.md). After that, the eligible Pods would get tagged with an annotation nodeportlocal.antrea.io, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 annotations:
   nodeportlocal.antrea.io: '[{"podPort":8080,"nodeIP":"10.102.47.229","nodePort":40002}]'
```

In AKO, this data is obtained from Pod Informers, and used while populating Pool Servers. For instance, in this case for the eligible pool, a server would be added with IP address 10.102.47.229 and port number 40002. All other objects would be created in Avi, similar to clusterIP mode.

To use NodePortLocal in standalone mode in Antrea without AKO, users have to annotate a service to make the backend Pods(s) eligible for NodePortLocal. In AKO, this is automated and the user does not have to annotate any service. AKO would annotate the services matching any one of the following criteria:
- All services of type LoadBalancer.
- For all ingresses, the backend ClusterIP Services would be obtained by AKO, and they would be annotated for enabling NPL. In case Ingress Class is being used, only the the ingresses for which Avi is the Ingress Class would be used for enabling NodePortLocal. 

For the Openshift objects: [Openshift](https://github.com/vmware/load-balancer-and-ingress-services-for-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/objects.md)
